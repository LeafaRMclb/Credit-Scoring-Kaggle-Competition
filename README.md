This Repository contains the notebook of a Credit Scoring pet project of mine. which uses features such as Monthly Income, Number of dependents, age of the borrower, open credit lines and real estate loans etc. to predict whether a certain instance/borrower will experience a financial distress in the next two years.  I used an ensemble tree models here which is RandomForestClassifer and GradientBoostingClassifier. I ended up using the GradientBoostingClassfier as it outperforms RF (usually most of the time) in its training and validation set. I am open for suggestions and discussions on how can I improve my score or other ideas that would greatly help my model. Thank you!
